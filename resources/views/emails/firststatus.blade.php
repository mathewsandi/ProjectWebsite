Hello there!<br><br>

I see you have posted your first status on the website! The status page is our own "chat system" as such! At Sezgi, we
have decided to remove the old chat box that we used over at enjin as we feel this new status gives a unique feel to the site!
We just wanted to give you some quick information in case you didn't already know! You can only see statuses that are your own,
or people that you follow. Use the status page to talk to other community members and to just tell us what your doing and update
the community on yourself. People will follow you if they want to see your stuff! As this is your first status post we have given
you some points towards your point tally!<br><br>

Thanks for reading this quick information package!<br><br>
